ShaderKit is an open-source collection of fragment shaders designed for use in SpriteKit games. The shaders are designed to be easy to read and understand, even for relative beginners, so you’ll find each line of code is rephrased in plain English as well as an overall explanation of the algorithm used at the top of each file.

If you’re already comfortable with shaders then please download one or more that interest you and get going. If not, most of the the remainder of this README acts as a primer for using shaders in SpriteKit.


## See it in action

This repository contains a cross-platform sample project demonstrating all the shaders in action. Although the shaders themselves work back to iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, the sample project is built using SwiftUI and requires iOS 16 and macOS 13.

## TL;DR

If you use SpriteKit, you can add special effects from ShaderKit to add water ripples, spinning black holes, flashing lights, embossing, noise, gradients, and more – all done on the GPU for maximum speed.

## What are shaders?

Fragment shaders are tiny programs that operate on individual elements of a sprite’s texture. They are sometimes called “pixel shaders” – it’s not a wholly accurate name, but it does make them easier to understand.

Effectively, a fragment shader gets run on every pixel in a texture, and can transform that pixel however it wants. That might sound slow, but it isn’t – all the fragment shaders here run at 60fps on iPhone 6 and newer, and 120fps on iPad Pro.

The transformation process can recolor the pixel however it wants. Users can customize the process by passing fixed values in to the shader (known as “uniforms”) and by assigning values to nodes that use the shader (known as “attributes”). SpriteKit also provides a few built-in values for us to work with, such as the texture co-ordinate for the pixel being modified and the current time.


## How are they written?

Shaders are written in OpenGL ES 2.0 shading language (GLSL), which is a simple, fast, and extremely efficient C-like language that is optimized for high-performance GPU operations. When you activate a shader in your app, it gets loaded and compiled at runtime, and in doing so should be optimized for whatever device the user has.

In each shader you’ll find a `main()` function, which is run when the shader activates. This must at some point assign a value to the pre-defined variable `gl_FragColor`, which represents the final color that will be used to draw the pixel.

GLSL comes with a wide variety of built-in data types and functions, many of which operate on more than one data types. The data types are nice and simple:

- `bool`: a boolean, i.e. true or false.
- `float`: a floating-point number. GLSL lets you request various precisions, but this isn’t used in ShaderKit. `float` numbers must be written using a decimal place – 1 is considered an integer, whereas `1.` or `1.0` will be considered a `float`.
- `vec2`: a two-component floating-point array. It’s used to hold things like X and Y co-ordinates or width and height.
- `vec3`: a three-component floating-point array. It’s used to hold things like RGB values.
- `vec4`: a four-component floating-point array. It’s used to hold things like RGBA values. 
- `void` is used to mark the `main()` function as not returning a value.

Shaders commonly move fluidly between `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, and `vec4` as needed. For example, if you create a `vec4` from a `float` then the number will just get repeated for each component in the vector. You’ll also frequently see code to create a `vec4` by using a `vec3` for the first three values (usually RGB) and specifying a fourth value as a `float`. 

Here are the functions used in ShaderKit:

- `cos()` calculates the cosine of a value in radians. The cosine will always fall between -1 and 1. If you provide `cos()` with a vector (e.g. `vec3`) it will calculate the cosine of each component in the vector and return a vector of the same size containing the results.
- `distance()` calculates the distance between two values. For example, if you provide it with a pair `vec2` you’ll get the length of the vector created by subtracting one from the other. This always returns a single number no matter what data type you give it.
- `dot()` calculates the dot product of two values. This means multiplying each component of the first value by the respective component in the second value, then adding the result.
- `floor()` rounds a number down to its nearest integer. If you pass it a vector this will be done for each component.
- `fract()` returns the fractional component of a value. For example, `fract(12.5)` is 0.5. If you pass this a vector then the operation will be performed component-wise, and a new vector will be returning containing the results.
- `min()` is used to find the lower of two values. If you pass vectors this is done component-wise, meaning that the resulting vector will evaluate each component in the vector and place the lowest in the resulting vector.
- `max()` is used to find the higher of two values. If you pass vectors this is done component-wise, meaning that the resulting vector will evaluate each component in the vector and place the highest in the resulting vector.
- `mix()` smooth interpolates between two values based on a third value that’s specified between 0 and 1, providing a linear curve.
- `mod()` is the modulus function, and calculates remainder after integer division. For example, 10 divides into 3 a total of three times, with remainder 1, so 10 modulo 3 is 1.
- `pow()` calculates one value raised to the power of another, for example `pow(2.0, 3.0)` evaluates to 2.0 * 2.0 * 2.0, giving 8.0. As well as operating on a `float`, `pow()` can also calculate component-wise exponents – it raises the first item in the first vector to the power of the first item in the second vector, and so on.
- `sin()` calculates the sine of a value in radians. The sine will always fall between -1 and 1. If you provide `sin()` with a vector (e.g. `vec3`) it will calculate the sine of each component in the vector and return a vector of the same size containing the results.
- `smoothstep()` interpolates between two values based on a third value that’s specified between 0 and 1, providing an S-curve shape. That is, the interpolation starts slow (values near 0.0), picks up speed (values near 0.5), then slows down towards the end (values near 1.0).
- `texture2D()` provides the color value of a texture at a specific location. This is most commonly used to read the current pixel’s color. (Technically this reads *texels*, but it’s easier to think about pixels while you’re learning.)

There is one further special function worth mentioning, which is `SKDefaultShading()`. This provides the default color SpriteKit was planning to render for the current fragment.


## Attributes and uniforms

Many shaders can operate without any special input from the user – it can manipulate the color data it was sent by SpriteKit, then send back new data.

However, often you’ll want to customize the way shaders work, a bit like passing in parameters to a function. Shaders are a little more complicated because these values need to be uploaded to the GPU, but the principle is the same.

ShaderKit uses two approaches for customizing shader behavior: uniforms and attributes. They are very similar, but the difference is that uniforms are attached to shaders and attributes are attached to nodes.

Almost everything is declared as a uniform in ShaderKit. So, if you want to customize the colors for your gradient, the strength of your water rippling, or the size of your interlacing lines, these are all specified as uniforms. 

However, one thing is consistently specified as an attribute, which is *node size*. Some shaders (see below) require the size of the node they are operating on, and although this *could* be specified as a uniform it would stop you from using the same shader on multiple nodes. So, instead it’s specified as an attribute: each sprite tells the shader how big it is, and that value combines with the uniforms inside the shader to produce the final result.

By convention, uniform names start with “u” and attribute names start with “a”. So, when you see “u_strength” you know it’s a uniform, and when you see “a_size” you know it’s an attribute.

**Please note note:** there is a performance cost to uploading uniform and attribute data to the GPU. As a result, you should only specify values that are actually used inside the shader.

This repository also contains ShaderKitExtensions.swift. This adds a handful of convenience initializers for setting uniforms and attributes from common types: `CGSize`, `CGPoint`, and `SKColor`. (NB: `SKColor` is either `UIColor` or `NSColor` depending on whether you’re using iOS/tvOS/watchOS or macOS.)

Although these extensions aren’t required, they will make it significantly easier to use the shaders provided here – you should add ShaderKitExtensions.swift to your own project alongside whichever shaders you want.

One of these extensions adds a new initializer for `SKShader` that loads a shader file into a string then creates an `SKShader` from that string, and assigns any uniforms or attribute settings. This is helpful while debugging, because shaders loaded from strings get debug information printed inside Xcode, so if you modify a shader incorrectly Xcode will help you understand the problem.

**All Swift code examples below use this initializer.**

As stated above, the only attribute you need to specify in any of the ShaderKit shaders is the sprite’s size. This is only required in some shaders (see below), and with ShaderKitExtension.swift is done like this:

```swift
yourSprite.setValue(SKAttributeValue(size: yourSprite.size), forAttribute: "a_size")
```


## Built-in values

SpriteKit provides several built-in values that are useful when building shaders:

- `u_texture`: the texture that is being rendered. You can read individual color values from this.
- `u_time`: how much time has elapsed in the game.
- `v_tex_coord`: the position of the current pixel in the texture. These are normalized to the bottom-left corner, meaning that (0.0, 0.0) is the bottom-left corner and (1.0, 1.0) is the top-right corner.
- `v_color_mix`: the color of the node being rendered.


## Reading the shaders

All the shaders in ShaderKit were specifically written for readability. Specifically, they:

1. All start with a brief comment outlining what each shader does.
2. List all input attributes and uniforms (where they are used), along with ranges and a suggested starting point.
3. An explanation of the algorithm used.
4. Detailed line-by-line English translations of what the code means.

The combination of what the code *does* (the interlinear comments) and what the code *means* (the algorithm introduction) should hopefully make these shaders comprehensible to everyone.

One small note: you will commonly see the final fragment color multiplied both by the original color’s alpha and the alpha value of `v_color_mix`. The former ensures the new color takes into account the alpha value of the original, which keeps edges smooth; the latter ensures the new color takes into account the alpha of the whole node, so that it can be faded in or out smoothly.


## Shaders included in ShaderKit
ShaderKit provides a selection of shaders, most of which allow some customization using uniforms. Some shaders are merely variations of others, provided separately to avoid too much of a performance hit.

## ShaderKit Sandbox

Inside this repository are example SpriteKit projects for iOS and macOS that demonstrate each of the shaders with some example values – try running them if you’re curious how each of the shaders look or perform on your device.

If you’ve modified one of the shaders and want to see how it looks, the sandbox is the best place. If you tap or click the screen the test nodes will alternate between alpha 0 and alpha 1 so you can make sure your modifications blend correctly.

The iOS sandbox has been tested on iPhone 6, 6s, 7, and X, as well as iPad Pro. The macOS sandbox has been tested on a retina MacBook Pro using macOS 10.13.

Note: although each of these filters could be ported to any shader-supporting platform with little work, I’ve tested them specifically on iOS/macOS and SpriteKit.


## Contributing

I made ShaderKit because not enough people know that shaders are powerful, easy ways to add special effects to your games. If you’d like to contribute your own shaders or modifications to existing shaders, that’s great! But first please read the following:

- ShaderKit has a strong emphasis on readability. Beginners should be able to read most of these shaders and have a good idea of how they work. If you want to make one of the shaders faster, please don’t do so at the expensive of readability.
- You must comment your code thoroughly. Shaders are often extremely terse, so please write in English above every line what the code does – a transliteration, if you will – and also provide a description of how it all works to produce the final result.
- All code must be licensed under the MIT license so it can benefit the most people.
